Description: The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller
 OpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD models.
 It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X.
 Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender)
 it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead
 on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for
 when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure
 is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating
 computer-animated movies.
 .
 OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like
 a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and
 renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer)
 full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change
 any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined
 by configurable parameters.
 .
 OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is
 constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion
 of 2D outlines. As data exchange format format for this 2D outlines
 Autocad DXF files are used. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is
 also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files
 OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.
